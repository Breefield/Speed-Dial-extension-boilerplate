## Speed Dial extension boilerplate

## Things to keep in mind:

### License

Please change the `<license>` element in `config.xml` to whatever makes the most sense for your project. As a default, it is set to Apache 2.0.
  
### options.html

If you don't need a preferences page, delete the options.html file. Otherwise, this is where you can interact with the `widget.preferences` storage object and set the preferences for the extension. Default preferences can be set in `config.xml` as `<preference>` elements.
